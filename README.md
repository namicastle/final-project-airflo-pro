# Microcontroller System with Thin-Film Transistor Display

## Overview

This project involved the development of a microcontroller system featuring a Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) display for displaying temperature, clock, date, and alarm settings. It leverages GPIOs, A/D converter, and sensors for precise data acquisition and advanced functionalities.

## Key Features

- **Microcontroller:** Utilized PIC18F4321.
- **Programmer:** PICkit3.
- **Temperature, Clock, Date, and Alarm Settings:** Displayed on the TFT display.
- **Precise Data Acquisition:** Utilized GPIOs, A/D converter, and sensors for accurate data collection.
- **PWM for Fan Control:** Implemented PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for fan control using the C programming language with MPLAB X IDE.
- **Efficient Communication:** Utilized I2C and SPI buses for efficient communication with peripherals such as RTC (Real-Time Clock) and IR remote control.
- **Collaborative Development:** Collaborated on hardware schematics development and project execution with a focus on innovation and teamwork.

## Implementation Details

- **Programming Language:** C programming language.
- **IDE:** MPLAB X IDE.
